## 1. Migration & State Management Summary

> _From: ZUSTAND_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md_

### Overview

This section summarizes the migration and implementation of enterprise-grade state management using [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) in the Lessonbloqs Composer codebase. It covers rationale, patterns, critical areas, and key implementation details for future maintainers.

#### Why Zustand?

- **Simplicity:** Minimal boilerplate, easy to use with React hooks.
- **Performance:** Fine-grained reactivity, avoids unnecessary re-renders.
- **Persistence:** Built-in middleware for localStorage/sessionStorage.
- **Scalability:** Suitable for both small and large apps.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Cleanly separates collaborative (Liveblocks) and non-collaborative (Zustand) state.

#### Key Migration Steps

- Store creation for UI, document, form, preferences, and app state.
- Component refactors to use global state and overlays.
- Controlled input fixes for all store-driven fields.
- Enhanced test components for manual verification.

#### Patterns & Best Practices

- Always use a default value for controlled inputs: `<Input value={storeValue ?? ""} ... />`
- Use `persist` middleware only for non-sensitive, user-specific settings.
- Keep collaborative state (Liveblocks) and app state (Zustand) separate.
- Centralize global loading and error overlays in `appStore`.
- Use barrel exports (`index.ts`) for easy store imports.
- Prefer selectors for store usage to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

#### Example: Global Loading/Error Usage

```tsx
const setGlobalLoading = useAppStore((s) => s.setGlobalLoading);
const setGlobalError = useAppStore((s) => s.setGlobalError);

const handleAsyncAction = async () => {
  setGlobalLoading(true, "Loading...");
  try {
    // ...async work...
  } catch (e) {
    setGlobalError("Something went wrong");
  } finally {
    setGlobalLoading(false, "");
  }
};
```

#### Controlled Input Example

```tsx
<Input value={storeValue ?? ""} onChange={...} />
```

#### Future Recommendations

- Continue to migrate any remaining local state to Zustand where global or cross-component access is needed.
- Use the test components for regression testing after major state changes.
- Document new store patterns and update this file as the app evolves.
